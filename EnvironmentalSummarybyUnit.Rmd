## Environmental comparison of hierarchy units
###Climate + BGC
###Site - aSMR, nutrients, topographic 
###Map


```{r ridgeline plot by hierarhcy unit}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut, fill = cut)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_ridges() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
